### Correct Code Example

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import userSchema from "./path/to/userSchema"; // Ensure you import the user schema correctly

// Check if the model is already defined; if not, define it
const Users = mongoose.models.Users || mongoose.model("Users", userSchema);

export default Users;
```

### Notes on the Code

1. **Model Definition**:

   - In Mongoose, models should be defined only once. The line `const Users = mongoose.models.Users || mongoose.model("Users", userSchema);` ensures that if the `Users` model has already been created (in case of serverless functions or hot reloading in Next.js), it will use that model instead of trying to create a new one. This prevents the error of trying to re-define a model.

2. **Schema Import**:

   - Make sure you import your schema from the correct path. The schema needs to be defined before you can create a model from it.

3. **Using Mongoose in Next.js**:

   - When using Mongoose with Next.js, especially in Edge functions, it's important to ensure that you handle the database connection properly. You might want to create a separate connection utility that checks for existing connections.

4. **Edge Functions**:
   - If your Next.js application is deployed on the Edge (for instance, using Vercel's Edge Functions), be aware of the limitations regarding database connections. Each edge function is stateless, so you'll need to connect to the database inside each request handler instead of maintaining a persistent connection.
