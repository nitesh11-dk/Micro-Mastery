// In page.jsx, we shouldn't use named exports, only default exports are allowed.

// If we create a layout inside a folder, it will be visible to all the children of that folder. And if the layout does not return its children, then nothing will be shown.

// Route group means a folder inside the app folder.
// For example, if you have a file `src/app/courses/java/page.jsx`, and you want the route to be `/java` instead of `/courses/java`, you can wrap the `(courses)` folder in a route group by adding parentheses around it.
