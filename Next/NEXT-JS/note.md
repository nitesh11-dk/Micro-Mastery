## Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications with ease. It offers features like automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and a file-based routing system, making it a preferred choice for many developers. Next.js enhances the development experience by providing built-in support for static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), which can lead to better SEO and faster load times compared to traditional client-side rendered applications.

## File Structure

The typical file structure for a Next.js application is as follows:

Conclusion:

In Next.js, when defining catch-all routes, the `[...name]` route is used for matching any path, like `name/anything`. However, if you want the route to be optional and allow it to match both `name/anything` and just `/` (the root), you should use `[[...name]]`.

The error you encountered occurs because you cannot use both a required and an optional catch-all route at the same level. For instance, having `[...posts]` (required) and `[[...posts]]` (optional) in the same directory will conflict. You should choose one type of catch-all route per level.

In summary:

- Use `[...name]` for required catch-all routes.
- Use `[[...name]]` for optional catch-all routes.
- Avoid defining both at the same level in the same directory.
